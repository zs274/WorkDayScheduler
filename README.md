# Work Day Scheduler

For this assignment, we were given two starter files - index.html and styles.css - and asked to make a work day scheduler. The time blocks had to change colour depending on if the time was in the past, present, or future. Also, anything entered in the text boxes had to be saved to local storage so they would still be there when the page is refreshed.

## Pseudo Code

The following is my thought process for what I needed to happen.
1. When the page loads, each time block will have a colour depending on if it’s in the past, present or future.
2. When the user clicks the input box, they will be able to type something in.
3. When they click the save button, their entered text will be saved to local storage.
4. When the page refreshes, the text will still be there. 

Based on this my code would have to - 
- Have a way of detecting the current time and then change the colours depending on that.
- Have a text area for the user to write in.
- Have a save button corresponding to each time block so the text can be saved to local storage in the right place.

## Difficulties

At first, I struggled a bit with trying to understand Moment.js and how to properly implement it to make the boxes change colour depending on the current time, but this was easily solved by reading the documentation. 

## Overall thoughts

I found this assignment fairly straightforward and much easier to manage than others in the past. I think I gained a lot of confidence in myself and my abilities doing this assignment as I thought I would struggle a lot with jQuery but I didn’t. I really enjoyed this assignment and feel like I learned a lot from it.
